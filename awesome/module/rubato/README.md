<h1 id="background">Background and Explanation</h1>

The general premise of this is that I don't understand how awestore works. That and I really wanted to be able to have an interpolator that didn't have a set time. That being said, I haven't made an interpolator that doesn't have a set time yet, so I just have this instead. It has a similar function to awestore but the method in which you actually go about doing the easing is very different.

When creating an animation, the goal is to make it as smooth as humanly possible, but I was finding that with conventional methods, should the animation be interrupted with another call for animation, it would look jerky and inconsistent. You can see this jerkiness everywhere in websites made by professionals and it makes me very sad. I didn’t want that for my desktop so I used a bit of a different method.

This jerkiness is typically caused by discontinuous velocity graphs. One moment it’s slowing down, and the next it’s way too fast. This is caused by just lazily starting the animation anew when already in the process of animating. This kind of velocity graph looks like this:

<img src="images/disconnected_graph.png" alt="Disconnected Velocity Graph" height=160/>

Whereas rubato takes into account this initial velocity and restarts animation taking it into account. In the case of one wanting to interpolate from one point to another and then back, it would look like this:

<img src="images/connected_graph.png" alt="Connected Velocity Graph" height=160/>

<sub><sup>okay maybe my graph consistancy is trash, what can I do...</sup></sub>

These are what they would look like with forwards-and-back animations. A forwards-than-forwards animation would look more like this, just for reference:

<img src="images/forwards_forwards_graph.png" alt="Forwards ForwardsGraph" height=160/>

To ask one of you to give these graphs as inputs, however, would be really dumb. So instead we define an intro function and its duration, which in the figure above is the `y=x` portion, an outro function and its duration, which is the `y=-x` portion, and the rest is filled with constant velocity. The area under the curve for this must be equal to the position for this to end up at the correct position (antiderivative of velocity is position). If we know the area under the curve for the intro and outro functions, the only component we need to ensure that the antiderivative is equal to the position would be the height of the graph. We find that with this formula:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}m=\frac{d %2B ib(F_i(1)-1)}{i(F_i(1)-1) %2B o(F_o(1)-1) %2B t}" height=50>

where `m` is the height of the plateau, `i` is intro duration, `F_i` is the antiderivative of the intro easing function, `o` is outro duration, `F_o` is the antiderivative of the outro easing function, `d` is the total distance needed to be traveled, `b` is the initial slope, and `t` is the total duration.

We then simulate the antiderivative by adding `v(t)` (or the y-value at time `t` on the slope graph) to the current position 30 times per second (by default, but I recommend 60). There is some inaccuracy since it’s not a perfect antiderivative and there’s some weirdness when going from positive slopes to negative slopes that I don’t know how to intelligently fix (I have to simulate the antiderivative beforehand and multiply everything by a coefficient to prevent weird errors), but overall it results in good looking interruptions and I get a dopamine hit whenever I see it in action.

There are two main small issues that I can’t/don’t know how to fix mathematically:
- It’s not perfectly accurate (it is perfectly accurate as `dt` goes to zero) which I don’t think is possible to fix unless I stop simulating the antiderivative and actually calc out the function, which seems time inefficient
- When going from a positive m to a negative m, or in other words going backwards after going forwards in the animation, it will always undershoot by some value. I don’t know what that value is, I don’t know where it comes from, I don’t know how to fix it except for lots and lots of time-consuming testing, but it’s there. To compensate for this, whenever there’s a situation in which this will happen, I simulate the animation beforehand and multiply the entire animation by a corrective coefficient to make it do what I want

So that’s how it works. I’d love any contributions anyone’s willing to give. I also have plans to create an interpolator without a set duration called `target` as opposed to `timed` when I have the time (or need it for my rice).

<h1 id="usage">How to actually use it</h1>

So to actually use it, just create the object, give it a couple parameters, give it some function to 
execute, and then run it by updating `target`! In practice it'd look like this:

```lua
timed = rubato.timed {
	intro = 0.1,
	duration = 0.5,
	subscribed = function(pos) print(pos) end
}

--you can also achieve the same effect as the `subscribed` parameter with this:
--timed:subscribe(function(pos) print(pos) end)

--target is initially 0 (unless you set pos otherwise)
timed.target = 1
--here it would print out a bunch of values (15 by default) which
--I would normally copy and paste here but my stdout is broken
--on awesome rn so just pretend there are a bunch of floats here

--and this'll send it back from 1 to 0, printing out another 15 #s
timed.target = 0
```

If you're familiar with the awestore api and don't wanna use what I've got, you can use those methods 
instead if you set `awestore_compat = true`. It’s a drop-in replacement, so your old code should work perfectly with it. If it doesn’t, please make an issue and I’ll do my best to fix it. Please include the broken code so I can try it out myself.

So how do the animations actually look? Let’s check out what I (at one point) use(ed) for my workspaces:

```lua
timed = rubato.timed {
	intro = 0.1,
	duration = 0.3
}
```

![Normal Easing](./images/trapezoid_easing.gif)

The above is very subtly eased. A somewhat more pronounced easing would look more like this:

```lua
timed = rubato.timed {
	intro = 0.5,
	duration = 1,
	easing = rubato.quadratic --quadratic slope, not easing
}
```

![Quadratic Easing](./images/quadratic_easing.gif)

The first animation’s velocity graph looks like a trapezoid, while the second looks like the graph shown below. Note the lack of a plateau and longer duration which gives the more pronounced easing:

![More Quadratic Easing](./images/triangleish.png)

<h1 id="why">But why though?</h1>

Why go through all this hassle? Why not just use awestore? That's a good question and to be fair you
can use whatever interpolator you so choose. That being said, rubato is solely focused on animation, has mathematically perfect interruptions and I’ve been told it also looks smoother.

Furthermore, if you use rubato, you get to brag about how annoying it was to set up a monstrous
derivative just to write a custom easing function, like the one shown in [Custom Easing
Function](#easing)'s example. That's a benefit, not a downside, I promise.

Also maybe hopefully the code should be almost digestible kinda maybe. I tried my best to comment
and documentate, but I actually have no idea how to do lua docs or anything.

Also it has a cooler name

<h1 id="arguments-methods">Arguments and Methods</h1>

**For rubato.timed**:

Arguments (in the form of a table):
 - `duration`: the total duration of the animation
 - `rate`: the number of times per second the timer executes. Higher rates mean
   smoother animations and less error.
 - `pos`: the initial position of the animation (def. `0`)
 - `intro`: the duration of the intro
 - `outro`: the duration of the outro (def. same as `intro`\*)
 - `inter`: the duration of the between-animation time (def. same as `intro`)
 - `prop_intro`: When `true`, `intro`, `outro` and `inter` represent proportional
   values; 0.5 would be half the duration. (def. `false`)
 - `easing`: the easing table (def. `interpolate.linear`)
 - `easing_outro`: the outro easing table (def. as `easing`)
 - `easing_inter`: the "intermittent" easing function, which defines which
   easing to use in the case of animation interruptions (def. same as
   `easing`)
 - `subscribed`: a function to subscribe at initialization (def. `nil`)
 - `override_simulate`: when `true`, will simulate everything instead of just
   when `dx` and `b` have opposite signs at the cost of having to do a little
   more work (and making my hard work on finding the formula for `m` worthless 
   :slightly_frowning_face:) (def. `false`)
 - `awestore_compat`: Make api even *more* similar to awestore's (def. `false`)

All of these values (except awestore_compat and subscribed) are mutable and changing them will
change how the animation looks. I do not suggest changing `pos`, however, unless you change the
position of what's going to be animated in some other way

\*with the caviat that if the outro being the same as the intro would result in an error, it would go
for the largest allowable outro time. Ex: duration = 1, intro = 0.6, then outro will default to 0.4.

Useful properties:
 - `target`: when set, sets the target and starts the animation, otherwise returns the target
 - `state`: immutable, returns true if an animation is in progress

Methods are as follows:
 - `timed:subscribe(func)`: subscribe a function to be ran every refresh of the animation
 - `timed:unsubscribe(func)`: unsubscribe a function
 - `timed:abort()`: stop the animation
 - `timed:restart()`: restart the animaiton from it's approximate initial state (if a value is 
 changed during the animation it will remain changed after calling restart)

Awestore compatibility functions (`awestore_compat` must be true):
 - `timed:set(target_new)`: sets the position the animation should go to, effectively the same 
 as setting target
 - `timed:initial()`: returns the intiial position
 - `timed:last()`: returns the target position, effectively the same as `timed.target`

Awestore compatibility properties:
 - `timed.started`: subscribable table which is called when the animation starts or is interrupted
   + `timed.started:subscribe(func)`: subscribes a function
   + `timed.started:unsubscribe(func)`: unsubscribes a function
 - `timed.ended`: subscribable table which is called when the animation ends
   + `timed.ended:subscribe(func)`: subscribes a function
   + `timed.ended:unsubscribe(func)`: unsubscribes a function

**builtin easing functions**
 - `easing.zero`: linear easing, zero slope
 - `easing.linear`: linear slope, quadratic easing
 - `easing.quadratic`: quadratic slope, cubic easing
 - `easing.bouncy`: the bouncy thing as shown in the example

<h1 id="easing">Custom Easing Functions</h1>

To make a custom easing function, it's pretty easy. You just need a table with two values:

 - `easing`, which is the function of the slope curve you want. So if you want quadratic easing
   you'd take the derivative, which would result in linear easing. **Important:** `f(0)=0` and
   `f(1)=1` must be true for it to look nice.
 - `F`, which is basically just the value of the antiderivative of the easing function at `x=1`.
   This is the antiderivative of the scaled function (such that (0, 0) and (1, 1) are in the
   function), however, so be wary of that.

In practice, creating your own easing would look like this:

1. Go to [easings.net](https://easings.net)

For the sake of this tutorial, we'll do an extremely complex easing, "ease in elastic"  

2. Find the necessary information

**Important:** You should really use sagemath or Wolfram Mathematica to get as exact of a derivative
as you can. Wolfram Alpha doesn't cut it. I personally used sagemath because it's actually free,
which is pretty cool. To take that one step further, I'd suggest using jupyter notebook in tandem
with sagemath because if you run `%display latex` you get a super good looking output. If you can't
use jupyter (or don't want to), `%display ascii_art` is a pretty cool alternative.

The initial function, given by [easings.net](https://easings.net), is as follows:  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f(x)=-2^{10 \, x - 10}\times \sin\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right))">

The derivative (via sagemath) is as follows:  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f^\prime (x)=-\frac{5}{3} \, {\left(2 \, \pi \cos\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right) %2B 3 \, \log\left(2\right) \sin\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right)\right)}\times 2^{10 \, x - 9}">

First we double check that `f'(0)=0`, which in this case it is not.  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f^\prime (0)=\frac{5}{1536} \, \sqrt{3} \pi - \frac{5}{1024} \, \log\left(2\right)">

so now we subtract `f'(0)` from `f'(x)` and get a pretty messy function, let's say `f_2(x)`.
Regrettably, we're about to mess up that function a little more.  Next we check that `f_2(1)=1`. In
this case, once again, it doesn't. We get  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f_2(1)=-\frac{5}{3072} \, \sqrt{3} {\left(2 \, \pi - 2049 \, \sqrt{3}\times \log\left(2\right)\right)}">

So now we divide our `f(x)` by `f(1)`, to get our final function, `f_e(x)` (easing function) (I am
so good at naming these kinds of things)  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}f_e(x)=\frac{6 \, \pi %2B \sqrt{3} \pi \times 2^{10 \, x %2B 2}\times \cos\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right) %2B 3 \, \sqrt{3}\times 2^{10 \, x %2B 1}\times \log\left(2\right) \sin\left(-\frac{43}{6} \, \pi %2B \frac{20}{3} \, \pi x\right) - 3 \, \sqrt{3}\times \log\left(2\right)}{3 \, {\left(2 \, \pi - 2049 \, \sqrt{3} \times\log\left(2\right)\right)}}">

Great... This is going to be a treat to write as lua... Anyways, our final step is to find the
definite integral from 0 to 1 of our `f(x)`, which is this  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{blue}\int_0^1 f_e(x) \,dx=\frac{20 \, \pi - 10 \, \sqrt{3}\times \log\left(2\right) - 2049 \, \sqrt{3}}{10 \, {\left(2 \, \pi - 2049 \, \sqrt{3}\times \log\left(2\right)\right)}}">

Now I'm sure that looks pretty daunting. However, these functions are kinda stupidly easy to find
with sagemath. You basically only have to run these commands:

```python
from sage.symbolic.integration.integral import definite_integral
function('f')
f(x)=factor(derivative('''your function goes here''', x))
f(x)=factor(f(x)-f(0))
f(x)=factor(f(x)/f(1))
print(f(x)) # easing
print(definite_integral(f(x), x, 0, 1)) # F
```

which will tell you all you need to know.

It's important to use the `factor(...)` thing because otherwise you may end up with decimals, which
really should be avoided if possible. When I didn't do factor, there were 0.499999s which makes it
decently less accurate and substantially more complicated.

4. Now we just have to translate this into an actual lua table. You might want to be careful about
   not doing more operations than necessary but honestly it probably doesn't much matter.

```lua
--all the constants are calculated only once
local cs = {
	c1 = 6 * math.pi - 3 * math.sqrt(3) * math.log(2),
	c2 = math.sqrt(3) * math.pi,
	c3 = 6 * math.sqrt(3) * math.log(2),
	c4 = 6 * math.pi - 6147 * math.sqrt(3) * math.log(2),
	c5 = 46 * math.pi / 6
}

bouncy = {
	F = (20 * math.pi - (10 * math.log(2) - 2049) * math.sqrt(3)) / 
		(20 * math.pi - 20490 * math.sqrt(3) * math.log(2)),
	easing = function(t)
		--short circuit
		if t == 0 then return 0 end
		if t == 1 then return 1 end

		--both of these values are reused
		local c1 = (20 * t * math.pi) / 3 - cs.c5
		local c2 = math.pow(2, 10 * t + 1) --in the 2^{10x+2} I factored out the 2 to calculate this once
		return (cs.c1 + cs.c2 * c2 * math.cos(c1) + cs.c3 * c2 * math.sin(c1)) / cs.c4
	end
}

timed = rubato.timed {
	intro = 0, --we'll use this as an outro, since it's weird as an intro
	outro = 0.7,
	duration = 1,
	easing = bouncy
}
```

We did it! Now to check whether or not it actually works

![Beautiful](./images/beautiful.gif)

While you can't see its full glory in 25 fps gif form, it really is pretty cool.  Furthermore, if it
works with *that* function, it'll probably work with anything. As long as you have the correct
antiderivative and it's properly scaled, you can probably use any (real, differentiable) function
under the sun.

Note that if it's not properly scaled, this can be worked around (if you're lazy and don't care
about a bit of a performance decrease). You can set `override_simulaton` to true. However, it is
possible that it will not perform exactly as you expected if you do this so do your best to just
find the derivative and antiderivative of the derivative.

<h1 id="install">Installation</h1>

So actually telling people how to install this is important, isn't it

It supports luarocks, so that'll cut it if you want a really really easy install, but it'll install
it in some faraway lua bin where you'll probably leave it forever if you either stop using rubato or
stop using awesome. However, it's certainly the easiest way to go about it. I personally don't like
doing this much because it adds it globally and I'm only gonna be using this with awesome, but it's
a really easy install.

```
luarocks install rubato
```

Otherwise, somewhere in your awesome directory, (I use `~/.config/awesome/lib`) you can run this
command: 

```
git clone https://github.com/andOrlando/rubato.git
```

Then, whenever you actually want to use rubato, do this at the start of the lua file: `local rubato
= require "lib.rubato"`

<h1 id="name">Why the name?</h1>

Because I play piano so this kinda links up with other stuff I do, and rubato really well fits the
project. In music, it means "push and pull of tempo" basically, which really is what easing is all
about in the first place. Plus, it'll be the first of my projects without garbage names
("minesweperSweeper," "Latin Learning").

<h1 id="todo">Todo</h1>
